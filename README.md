# Toys_Store_Analysis 

#### Data on sales and inventory for Maven Toys, a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico, including information on products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location 
the data was provided by Maven Analytics : https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=3
#### I'm trying to answer these business questions: 

Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?

Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?

How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?
